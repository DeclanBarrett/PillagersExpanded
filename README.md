# PillagersExpanded
Adds a new patrol system to Minecraft

Currently patrols in Minecraft are random, have a low chance of spawning and are quite uninteresting. 
They are the access point of the raid system if the player has not found a pillager outpost.

Novemeber 2021 - Originally the scope of this plugin was simply to upgrade the patrol system that exists in Minecraft by allowing pillager patrols to be created at pillager outposts
and move from pillager outpost to pillager outpost. This was implemented.

December 2021 - Additionally to add some spice, pillager patrols were then made to be able to be upgraded. With each pillager outpost they visited and each encounter with the player they survived, they gained levels and attributes

June 2021 - Spigot Breaks the FindStructure command
